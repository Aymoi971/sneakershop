The new take on the AJ2 showcases an off-white cracked leather upper with burgundy piping and a translucent heel counter extending into the midfoot. 'Maniére' is stamped in white lettering on the burgundy leather heel tab while contrasting black accents are featured on the laces, quilted interior lining and tongue with snakeskin detailing and a retro Wings logo. The black snakeskin motif is repeated on the midsole inspired by the 1986 Air Jordan 2 that was made in Italy and featured a subtle reptilian texture on the leather upper."
